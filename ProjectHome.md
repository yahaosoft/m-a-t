This is my page for listing and hosting all my AutoIt projects to date! Thanks to Google and their brilliant free hosting, and other tools such as command line uploading, this is very easy and simple for me to administer and also (hopefully) for you to use.

Right now I', working on a large UDF on consoles. It's already got 83+ functions and over 3500 lines of code, but few examples. Want to help out? [Console.au3](http://code.google.com/p/consoleau3/).

I am currently running:
  * Windows Vista Home premium sp2
  * Chromium 20.0.1115.1 dev
  * AutoIt (stable) version 3.3.8.1 and beta 3.3.9.5 (NB: Most of my scripts are still 3.3.0.0, so you may want to update the Adlib functions. All Executables will work though.)

I try and test my scripts on at least a few computers before posting them, but there may be problems with outdated functions and Dll's, if so then please email me or if you are on the forums then send a PM and I'll do what I can to help out.

Feel free  to PM me or post a comment in any of threads (related to the program if possible :) ), I will try to sort out any problems you notify me about. I am in the process of writing my GCSE's at the moment, so I do not have a lot of time on my hands, however, I could argue it's some extra ICT revision so I will try to fix it. I have deliberately disabled the inbuilt google code issue tracker because I think its a lot easier going through the forums, if you do not have a login for the forums then emailing me is the next easiest way.

have a nice day :)
